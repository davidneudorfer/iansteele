    <p> After integrating a feature-rich assessment authoring platform, LearnZillion broke free from only being able to have one item per question. Instead, a single question could now have multiple parts which could be any combination of auto-graded and/or manually graded.</p>
    <p>We needed a way to quickly let see teachers how their classes are doing, while allowing them to easily see which questions required their attention.</p>
